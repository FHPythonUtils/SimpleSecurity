## 2020.4 - 2020/10/16
- Add PyGraudit https://github.com/FHPythonUtils/PyGraudit
  - Pretty fast
  - Not particularly accurate - lots of false negatives
- semgrep https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep
  - Pretty slow (looking at 30s to run 110 tests)
  - Pretty good (probably on par with bandit)
- Added `--fast/--skip` to skip past slow plugins when running all plugins
  - This will skip `semgrep` (saving 30s of 35s in tests)
  - This will run a less reliable instance of `dodgy` (saving 3s of 5s in tests)
  - ...so runtime is taken down from around 35s to 2s
- Using semgrep rules 2020/10/16 52d7424

- Deduplicator has moved to filter - Use
  `from simplesecurity.filter import deduplicate` to use the deduplicator

  - Filter level/ severity and confidence from the command line with -l INT
    and -s INT
- Added colour modes: 0 for no colour, 1 for colour, 2 for high contrast
  - Use -Z from the command line for high contrast and -z for no colour
- Minor tweaks

## 2020.2 - 2020/10/13
- New deduplication engine - So no more duplicates when running from the command
  line! Use `from simplesecurity.deduplicate import deduplicate` to use the
  deduplicator downstream.
- `id`s are now included in findings and are included in json and csv output

## 2020.1.4 - 2020/10/13
